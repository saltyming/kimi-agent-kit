# Model and Effort Choice

Which model and effort a subagent, a dispatch step or a consultation runs on, where the user, the prefs (§ 8) or the call has not fixed it. The table covers this harness's own models only: a dispatch step or a consultation on another vendor's backend runs on the model its prefs name, else on that backend's default. The table places the models by the vendor's own statements; a figure compares tiers on one vendor page and ranks no vendor against another.

- Choose by the shape of the work. Scoped work, whose shape is given (a named fix, a search, a mechanical edit across any number of files, a review against a checklist), runs on the cheapest tier the table lists for that kind of work, at the tier's starting effort; in the kit's own runs higher effort on such work bought time and cost, not results. Work that needs design reasoning (implementing an RFC, a change whose shape the delegate must work out) runs at high; xhigh and max only where a check shows a gain.
- A lower tier is neither a lower effort nor a smaller task: the delegate gets the same scope, the same self-contained prompt and the same verification it would get on the top model (§ 15), and never runs below its listed starting effort. The leader confirms that a check a lower tier reports was run.
- A delegate on scoped work names its model through the harness's per-call or default setting, where the harness has one, instead of inheriting the session's; an inherited top model bills every delegate's reading at the top rate.
- Parallel workers on a lower tier cut wall time when the work splits into many independent pieces; they cut cost only on routine pieces or on work too large for one context. One dependent chain stays with one model.

## Kimi Code models (as of 2026-10-08)

| Model | Tier | Use for | Start effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `k3` | frontier, 1M | hard problems: complex reasoning, algorithm design, deep debugging | high |
| `k3-256k` | frontier, 256K | as `k3` when 256K is enough, at half the quota | high |
| `kimi-for-coding` (K2.8 Preview) | workhorse | most feature work and code changes; routine edits, explanations, summaries | high |
| `kimi-for-coding-highspeed` (K2.7 Code) | fast | the workhorse's work when latency matters | thinking on |

- Highspeed costs about 3x the quota: choose it for speed, never to save cost.
- A subagent names a model by its alias in the `[secondary_model]` pool (for example `kimi-code/k3`); a model outside the pool cannot be named, and without a pool a subagent runs on the session's model.
- Thinking off serves `k3` and K2.8 requests from K2.8 Preview without thinking. Switching model or effort mid-session drops the prompt cache.
